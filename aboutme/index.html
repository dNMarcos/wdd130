        <p>Hello, I am Diana Marcos, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
        Saints since I was 16 years old. I am from Mexico, and I live in a little town about
        2 hours of the Mexico City.
        <br><br>I am a student of Bachelor's Degree in Professional Studies focused in programming
        and system administration. I work in a pharmaceutical company.
        <br><br>I enjoy reading classic books because they have amazing stories and
        neither the time was an impediment for those brilliants authors to count their stories to us,
        also y enjoy playing videogames, but just a little because I am not good in them.
        <br><br>The most I love of BYUI is the way that people/members and instructors interact between all
        even if we live in different countries and the way that all of us share experiences,
        opinions and advices. 
        <br><br>Having knowledge about the Web Design is an advantage because we can digitalize process
        that benefit us in our jobs, or for better opportunities of work, never is enough to learn extra topics.
